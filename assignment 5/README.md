## Academic integrity statement
I used **AI and Google to look up or clarify specific concepts I did not understand** (for example, regex syntax or addEventListener usage).
I use **AI to help me analyze the parts of the homework requirements that I don’t understand**, and **organize the knowledge points of the materials** given by our professor.
