# Assignment 6 · API App (Ghibli Films)

This is my web page that uses a free API from the website shared by our professor:
**https://ghibliapi.vercel.app**. It lists Studio Ghibli films, supports a
title search, and shows film details.

- No API key required.
- HTTPS only.
- HTML/CSS/JS.

## Files
- `index.html` — semantic HTML with a small form and result/ detail sections.
- `styles.css` — basic styling.
- `app.js` — JavaScript using `fetch()` and `.then()` chains.

## How to run
1. Put these three files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click **List All** (loads first 20 films) or type part of a film title (e.g., `Totoro`) and click **Search**.
4. Click **Details** on any film to see more info.
