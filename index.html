            Hi, my name is <strong>Jing Cao</strong>, and I am a cheerful and curious girl who loves to explore 
            new things. I enjoy making friends, sharing stories, and spreading positive energy 
            everywhere I go.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently studying and also learning web development. It’s so much fun to 
            create cute and colorful pages like this one! One of my dreams is to design a 
            personal blog where I can share my daily life, art, and thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in kindness and <strong>empathy</strong>, and I always try to look at the 
            bright side of life. I think being <em>creative</em> makes everyday special.
        </p>
