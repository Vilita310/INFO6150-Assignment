        <!-- Self-introduction -->
        <p>
            Hi, my name is <strong>Jing Cao</strong>. I am a cheerful and curious girl who loves to explore new things and spend time with cute animals—especially dogs! I enjoy making friends, sharing stories, and filling my life with positivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am learning web development, and I love creating colorful pages like this. One of my dreams is to have a personal blog where I can share art, daily life, and my adventures with pets.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in kindness and <strong>empathy</strong>, and always try to find joy in small moments. Being <em>creative</em> makes every day feel special.
        </p>
